Preamble

While this is probably not a legally binding license per se, this serves as a clarification of what you should and shouldn't do with this repo, under general copyright law.

This is the repo for my profile. As such, there may be personal imformation that I do not want shared without explicit written and signed permission. I will briefly outline things you are explicitly allowed and not allowed to do. In the absence of specifics, copyright law stands. The following applies specifically to text based files, that is, files which can be opened and read by a typical text editor. Images and other forms of media may have their own licenses, which, if applicable will be listed at the end of this document.

Section 1: Allowed Usage

You are explicitly ALLOWED to:
- View the content of this profile at my profile page on github.com or in the Github repo where it is listed
- Share a direct, unmodified link to the same public content on my Github account
- Use ONLY the README-TEMPLATE.md file as a template for your own profile or other usage, with no restrictions

Section 2: Forbidden Usage

You are explicitly FORBIDDEN to:
- Use any part of this repo, in whole or part, for private, public, free, commercial or any other use not mentioned herein, except for exceptions listed in Section 1
- Use a verbatim or slightly modified version of this profile or repo as if it were your own
- Fork, clone, or otherwise acquire a version of this repo for any reason

Section 3: Waiver Options

Section 2's restrictions may be waived with explicit written AND signed permission from the copyright holder, referenced in line 1 of this document.

Section 4: License Usage

You may use a verbatim or modified copy of this so-called license. However you MUST replace the copyright notice on line 1 with one that is applicable to you and you may not pretend that your license is the same as this one nor hold me legally liable in any way for any holes in this so-called license that may or may not exist.

Section 5: License Exceptions

While there is no such content as of now, any images or other forms of non-text based media may be released under their own license and if that is the case, will be listed, with their relevant license in this section. Please reference the Preamble above.

Also, if you wish to use my profile as a template, you may use the README-TEMPLATE.md file which will be a blank version of my profile with no personal information. Please reference Section 1 above.
